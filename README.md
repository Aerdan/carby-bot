# Carbybot

Hi! I'm Discord!Carbybot, made by AlphaKretin, based off of the IRC!Carbybot made by Kyrosiris! I'm here to make Fiestaing easier! If you have other suggestions for commands, let Kyrosiris or someone with the Robit Helper role know. They'll try to add it. Unlike the dumb IRC version of Carbybot, I can accept PMs! Yay!

You can use `.help` to get a link to this readme. Note that while the "intended" prefix alternates between commands, they all work with either `.` or `!`, so don't feel compelled to memorise which is which.

## Mechanical Tips/Useful things

See also the section on the enemy database.

### .mcalc

**Usage**: `.mcalc type stat [stat stat]`

This calculates attack multipliers, or "M", and the next level at which it will increase, based on your stats. If you're not sure what M is, check out [this primer](https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3889977&userid=0&perpage=40&pagenumber=4#post495448811) I wrote about it.

If you just enter `.mcalc` or otherwise invalid input, Carby will guide you through the process. Carby accepts the following M types, with required stats in the order listed.

-   `physical`: Level, Strength. Used for most weapons.
-   `magic`: Level, Magic. Used for magic.
-   `knife`: Level, Strength, Agility. Used for knives, bows, whips, etc.
-   `chicken`: Level, Strength, Agility. Used for the Chicken Knife.
-   `rune`: Level, Strength, Magic. Used for the Rune Axe etc.
-   `fists`: Level, Strength. Used for unarmed attacks.
-   `cannon`: Level. Used for !Open Fire.

### .almagest

**Usage**: `.almagest [stamina|Job]`

This recites how much HP you need to survive the final boss' powerful Almagest attack. If you include a Stamina value, or the name of a job class, Carby will calculate the Level you need to have that much HP.

### .math

**Usage**: `.math level`

This calculates how many times you'll need to cast the Blue Magic Dark Spark on an enemy of a given level, halving their level rounding down, to make it a multiple of 2, 3, 4 or 5 for the various Level X Blue Magic spells.

### !mix

**Usage**: `!mix to name`, `!mix from ingredient [+ ingredient]`

This recites the effects and ingredients of the mixes made with the Chemist's !Mix ability. Use `!mix to` to look up a mix by the name of the result, and get its effects and all of its possible ingredient sets, `!mix from ingredient + ingredient` to look up a mix by the two ingredients you're using, to get the same information, or `!mix from ingredient` with just one ingredient to get a list of all the mixes you can make with that ingredient, with the other ingredients you'll need for each mix.

### !combine

**Usage**: `!combine item|name`

This recites the effects of the mixes made with the Cannoneer's !Combine ability. Carby can find a combination from either the main ingredient, or the name of the attack. Thanks to Aerdan for assembling this data.

### .class

**Usage**: `.class name`

This recites information about a Job class, such as its base stats and learned abilities. The name `.class` is chosen over `.job` to avoid conflicts with `.jobs`.

### .timer

This displays the current state of a countdown until the next relevant date, be it preregistration or The Run.

### .color

This generates a random set of three 0-7 numbers, used for FFV Advance's menu colour option, and reacts to your message with them. Because reactions have to be unique, duplicate numbers are represented with â—€ and âž•.

## Fun Stat Tracking

These commands keep track of various fun stats about our playthroughs. People donate based on these totals, so keep them coming and keep them honest!

### .trapped

This registers that you fell in the speed trap, an obstacle pictured below.
![speed trap](http://i.imgur.com/887zUa3.png)

### .victims

This recites the number of people who have fallen in the speed trap.

### .break

**Usage**: `.break [number]`

This registers that you broke some rods. This means equipping a Rod weapon, pressing up on the Item menu in-battle to check your equipment, then click the Rod twice while it's equipped to use it. This casts a high-level spell of that element and destroys it, a useful crutch in the early game. You can include a number to register breaking multiple in one fight, or to save up a play session worth.

### .broken

This recites the number of rods people have broken.

### .jobs

**Usage**: `.jobs register job job job job`, `.jobs lookup [@User]`

This keeps track of what Jobs people have been assigned, for reference when asking for advice etc. When registering, Carby accepts any 4 strings seperated by spaces. People have a trend of using emoji, so a table of likely meanings is below. When looking up a user, Carby will try to find them if you just type their name, but you might have to @mention them. If you don't include a user, it will recite your own registered jobs.

| Job Name   | Emoji |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Knight     | âš”ðŸ›¡    |
| Black Mage | âš«    |

### .forbiddenrisk

This adds you to a role designating that you braved `#regForbidden #BERSERKERRISK` in 2018 when it was new and unknown.

### .forbiddenlite

This adds you to a role designating that you braved `#regForbidden`, without Berserker Risk, in 2018 when it was new and unknown.

### .winnerrisk

This adds you to a role designating that you braved `#regWinner #BERSERKERRISK` in 2019 when it was new and unknown.

### .winnerlite

This adds you to a role designating that you braved `#regWinner`, without Berserker Risk, in 2019 when it was new and unknown.

## DIY Fiesta

**Usage**: `.runtype[+modifier]`

These commands all generate a Four Job Fiesta Job set according to the chosen rules. They support the following additional modifiers after a `+` (e.g. `.normal+forbidden`). Modifiers come in four categories - you can only use 1 modifier from each category, but you can combine multiple categories as you please.

#### Challenge

-   `+forbidden`/`+void`: A random Job will be "lost to the void". After you enter the final dungeon, you can no longer use it or its abilities.
-   `+fifthjob`: A fifth Job will be assigned to Krile. When she joins your party, you can no longer use your Earth Job and instead use this fifth Job.

#### Job Set

-   `+750`: You will only be assigned magical jobs, namely White Mage, Black Mage, Blue Mage, Time Mage, Summoner, Red Mage, Geomancer, Bard, Chemist and Dancer.
-   `+no750`: You will only be assigned physical jobs, namely Thief, Monk, Knight, Mystic Knight, Berserker, Ninja, Beastmaster, Raner, Samurai and Dragoon.

#### #BERSERKERRISK

-   `+lowrisk`: This modifier emulates a low chance of berserker risk - there is a 12% chance per crystal that up to one crystal's job will be replaced by our good friend Zerky.
-   `+risk`: This modifier emulates a moderate chance of berserker risk - there is a 25% chance per crystal that up to two crystal's jobs will be replaced by our good friend Zerky.
-   `+highrisk`: This modifier emulates the near-mandate-like chance of berserker risk - there is a 50% chance per crystal that up to three crystal's jobs will be replaced by our good friend Zerky.
-   `+blameeverhate`: You know what this does.

#### Utility

-   `+hide`: Carby will PM you your jobs with the non-Wind jobs spoiler tagged, so you can play like a "traditional" Fiesta.

You can only use one each out of `+forbidden`/`+fifthjob` and `+750`/`+no750`, but you can use one from each pair.

### .normal

These are the normal Fiesta rules. At each crystal, the Job you are assigned will come from the group that crystal gave you.

### .random

At each crystal, the Job you are assigned will come from any crystals you already have unlocked, but not future ones.

### .chaos

You can be assigned any normal job at any crystal, with duplicates allowed.

### .purechaos

You can be assigned any normal job, as well as the special jobs Mime and Freelancer, at any crystal, with no duplicates.

### .advance

Jobs are re-arranged in order to fit the 3 bonus GBA version jobs, Gladiator, Oracle and Cannoneer, in the Earth Crystal. Assigns jobs like Normal.

-   Wind: Normal Wind Jobs and Time Mage
-   Water: Red Mage, Summoner, Berserker, Mystic Knight, Beastmaster, Geomancer and Ninja
-   Fire: Bard, Ranger, Dancer and Normal Earth Jobs
-   Earth: Gladiator, Oracle and Cannoneer

### .forbidden

This is mostly an obsolete alias for `.advance+forbidden`, with the special stipulation that your Earth Job cannot be Forbidden. It does not support other modifiers.

### .750

This is an obsolete alias for `.normal+750`, and does not support other modifiers.

### .no750

This is an obsolete alias for `.normal+no750`, and does not support other modifiers.

### .chaos750

This is an obsolete alias for `.chaos+750`, and does not support other modifiers.

### .chaosno750

This is an obsolete alias for `.chaos+no750`, and does not support other modifiers.

## Enemy database

Thanks to DigiPack (Sakako), Carby has a full database of all the enemies in FFV. These commands look them up and display their information. If you search a phrase that matches the names of multiple enemies, Carby will continue with you in DMs, just type the number next to the name you wanted. Carby knows names from both the GBA version onwards and the RPGe fan translation.

### .ai

**Usage**: `.ai name`

**Usage**: `.loot name`

This provides an enemy's item drops and steals.

### .stats

**Usage**: `.stats name`

### .weak

### .ability
